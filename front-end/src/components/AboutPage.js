              <p>
                Katherine is a full-stack web developer based in Vancouver.
                During the project, her focus was building the daily mood
                selection features and displaying the corresponding data for the
                moodscape. Her favorite part of this project was using her fine
                arts education and creativity to bring the user interface design
                to life. When she isn't programming, she is making jewelry,
                birdwatching, or spending time at the beach.

                Mo Mo is a Calgary-based software engineer with prior experience
                in software development. Her focus on the mojo project was to

                and, checklist customization features. When sheâ€™s not busy
                challenging herself with new coding techniques, she can be found
                hiking in the Canadian Rockies or knitting at home with her cat,
                Chia.

                Originally from the UK, Charlie is a full-stack developer based
                in Vancouver. He has a background in psychology so creating an
                app related to emotional awareness was of particular interest to
                him. His favourite part of this project was working with the
                Spotify API to develop the Moodify feature, and diving deeper
                into coding with React.{" "}
